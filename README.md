# Hi there!
...uhh, now that i think about it, there's nothing for me to write here except-
## FUTURE open-source project PLANS
* [ ] Finish working on SourceDEFUN
* [ ] Make a Truck simulator in SourceDEFUN (inspired after one GMod play session with Simfphys addon and a ball-socket cargo attachment in gm_fork)
* [ ] Make a retro winter game based on original Quake source code so that it would run on 386 :)

  AND PROBABLY MORE!
