# Hi there! 🤗

👩‍🔬 I'm currently working on [SourceDEFUN](https://github.com/SourceDEFUN/Engine)

😬 I'm currently learning how it feels like to study in colleges... Yikes!

💬 Ask me about Source Engine's licensing stuff, i'm an expert at it 😎

⚡ Fun fact: `memdbgon must be the last include file in a .cpp file!!!`


## FUTURE open-source project PLANS
1. Finish working on SourceDEFUN
2. Make a Truck simulator in SourceDEFUN (inspired after one GMod play session with Simfphys addon and a ball-socket cargo attachment in gm_fork)
3. Make a retro winter game based on original Quake source code so that it would run on 386 :)
4. Start making a Game Engine from scratch, TaigaGE.
5. Make a custom OS from scratch
6. Make (or atleast try to) online accounts for Linux. now now alright, i know that sounds bad-

<details><summary>6th idea explanation</summary><p>
Let me explain this one: You make a Linux server that stores your home folder, and then you'll use this project to log into your Linux system from any point of this universe.

Pros:
* No need to constantly synchronize between devices - just login!
* No need to store your home folder on an external SSD/HDD and accidentally lose it!

Cons:
* You'll need an internet connection - and preferably a fast one, depending on how much files you have
* It is up to you to make your server secure - otherwise, face *unforeseen consequences* once somebody finds out about your server's IP address.
