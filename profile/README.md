# Hi there! 🤗

👩‍🔬 I'm currently working on [SourceDEFUN](https://github.com/SourceDEFUN/Engine)

😬 I'm currently learning how it feels like to study in colleges... Yikes!

💬 Ask me about Source Engine's licensing stuff, i'm an expert at it 😎

⚡ Fun fact: `memdbgon must be the last include file in a .cpp file!!!`


## FUTURE open-source project PLANS
* [ ] Finish working on SourceDEFUN
* [ ] Make a Truck simulator in SourceDEFUN (inspired after one GMod play session with Simfphys addon and a ball-socket cargo attachment in gm_fork)
* [ ] Make a retro winter game based on original Quake source code so that it would run on 386 :)
* [ ] Start making a Game Engine from scratch, TaigaGE.
* [ ] Make a custom OS from scratch
